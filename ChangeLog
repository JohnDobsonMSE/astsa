Version 1.4 - July 2016
---------------------------

+ sarima has a t-table now (no p-values)

+ data set 'ar1boot' is gone (example uses simulated data) 

+ minor tweaks to lag1.plot and lag2.plot displays

+ added 'sp500w'- an xts data set, S&P500 weekly returns

+ updated man pages for new edition

---------------------------
Version 1.3  -  Nov 2014
---------------------------

+ sarima now allows inclusion of 'xreg' to facilitate 
    regression with autocorrelated errors 

+ fixed acf2 so grid in under plot

+ star data added

+ sunspotz man page emphasizes data are 2 times/year

+ fixed estimate of cov(v_t) = R in EM0 and EM1 (t=1 part was missing)

+ fixed typo in EMx missing code (0=observed, 1=missing)

+ EM1 fixed so inputs are not allowed (and no longer included in the call):

    Inputs are not allowed. The script uses Ksmooth1, but everything 
     related to inputs are set equal to zero.  That was the original 
     intent of this script.
  
    It would be relatively easy to include estimates of 'Ups' and 'Gam' 
     because conditional on the states, these are just regression coefficients.  
     If you decide to alter EM1 to include estimates of the 'Ups' or 'Gam', feel 
     free to notify me with a working example and I'll include it in the 
     next update (assuming it's correct, of course). Instructors... this would be
     an awesome class project.


---------------------------
Version 1.2  - March 2014
---------------------------

+ Fixed man page for the scripts 'stoch.reg' and for the 'Kfilter's and 'Ksmooth's

+ acf2 can take additional 'acf' arguments like na.action=na.omit ...

+ acf2 max vertical axis was always 1; now it depends on data

+ acf2 now has grid lines

+ FDR man entry corrected

+ Kfilter1; changed Ups and Gam == 0 case to match Kfilter2's appropriate method

+ astsadata() is gone, 'LazyData: true' instead
 

-------------------------
Version 1.1  - July 2012
-------------------------

+ In R scripts, added 'stats' package name to most calls, e.g., acf(...)  became  stats::acf(...)   ... but  didn't do it for functions in 'base'
 
+ Added data set 'blood' (based on code in Example 6.1) as an mts object of the Jones data set with NA as missing data code. Example 6.9 still uses 0 for missing data.  

+ Added links to related data sets in some man pages (e.g., oil <-> gas ...)

+ Added 'astsadata.R' to load all the data sets at once.

+ Changed 'mvspec.R' so it could be used in place of 'spec.pgram' and 'spectrum'.  The defaults are similar now to spec.prgram, but the default is not to taper, forcing the user to think about it.  It also returns the book's more useful definition of bandwidth.  


-------------------------
Version 1.0  - June 2012
-------------------------

+ astsa built from tsa3.rda with the following changes:

       in astsa   is   in tsa3   
      =========================
      arma.spec()    spec.arma() 
      lag1.plot()    lag.plot1() 
      lag2.plot()    lag.plot2() 

  but arma.spec, lag1.plot, and lag2.plot are now included in tsa3.rda (which won't be updated again).
